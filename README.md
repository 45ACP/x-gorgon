## Description

```js
 * TikTok's network traffic is protected using HTTPS, sometimes an additional layer of encryption named "ttEncrypt" is used. 
 * TikTok’s API requests are protected with a custom signature in the HTTP header named “X-Gorgon.” 
 * This signature is to prevent third-party programs from imitating and sending TikTok API requests.
